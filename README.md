Comments on code:

The goal was- to create another webpage, using Picogram project as a template.

The idea of the new Webpage - in the "About the Project" file.

What was done - most of the activities were new to me. :)
  'theanswer.jsx' page -
  'todolist.jsx' in components - a constructor, getting random values from an array and displaying.
   some basic  styling
   logo icon
